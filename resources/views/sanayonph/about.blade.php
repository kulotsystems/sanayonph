The project was intended to be a practice for them as future entrepreneurs. At such, when they thought about how business and community should compliment each other in achieving collective goals, the young and perceptive owners concluded with the concept of Sanayon. The owners were able to apply their individual skills to create the concept from the ground up. More so, share awareness to their advocacies such as sustainable livelihood and responsible exchange.</p>
